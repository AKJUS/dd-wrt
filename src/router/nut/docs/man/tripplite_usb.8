tripplite_usb \- Driver for older Tripp Lite USB UPSes (not PDC HID)

.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
This driver should work with older Tripp Lite UPSes which are detected as USB HID\-class devices, but are not true HID Power\-Device Class devices\&. So far, the devices supported by tripplite_usb have product ID 0001, and the newer units (such as those with "LCD" in the model name) with product ID 2001 require the \fBusbhid-ups\fR(8) driver instead\&.
.sp
Please report success or failure to the nut\-upsuser mailing list\&. A key piece of information is the protocol number, returned in ups\&.firmware\&.aux\&. Also, be sure to turn on debugging (\fI\-DDD\fR) for more informative log messages\&.
.sp
If your Tripp Lite UPS uses a serial port, you may wish to investigate the \fBtripplite\fR(8) or \fBtripplitesu\fR(8) drivers\&.

This driver has been tested with the following models:

On the other hand, if the web page for your UPS on the Tripp\-Lite website says "HID\-compliant USB port also enables direct integration with built\-in power management and auto\-shutdown features of Windows and MAC OS X", then you should use the \fBusbhid-ups\fR(8) driver instead\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"

This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5) file (or with \fI\-x\fR on the command line):
.PP
\fBport =\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Some
\fIvalue\fR
must be set, typically
\fBauto\fR\&.

\fBNote\fR

This could be a device filesystem path like
/dev/usb/hiddev0
but current use of libusb API precludes knowing and matching by such identifiers\&. They may also be inherently unreliable (dependent on re\-plugging and enumeration order)\&. At this time the actual
\fIvalue\fR
is ignored, but syntactically some
\fIport\fR
configuration must still be there\&.

It is possible to control multiple UPS units simultaneously by running several instances of this driver, provided they can be uniquely distinguished by setting some combination of the \fBvendor\fR, \fBproduct\fR, \fBvendorid\fR, \fBproductid\fR, \fBserial\fR, \fBbus\fR and/or \fBdevice\fR options detailed below\&. For devices or operating systems that do not provide sufficient information, the \fBallow_duplicates\fR option can be of use (limited and risky!)

\fBvendorid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproductid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBvendor =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproduct =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBserial =\fR \fIregex\fR
.RS 4
Select a specific UPS, in case there is more than one connected via USB\&. Each option specifies an extended regular expression (see
\fBregex(7)\fR
for more information on regular expressions), which must match the UPS\(cqs entire respective vendor/product/serial string (minus any surrounding whitespace), or the whole 4\-digit hexadecimal code for
vendorid
and
productid\&.

\fBlsusb(8)\fR

If you have several UPS devices which may not be uniquely identified by the options above (e\&.g\&. only VID:PID can be discovered there), this flag allows each driver instance where it is set to take the first match if available, or proceed to try another\&.

Normally the driver initialization would abort at this point claiming "Resource busy" or similar error, assuming that the otherwise properly matched device is unique \(em and some other process already handles it\&.

This regex is matched against the full USB product string as seen in lsusb(8)\&. The

.RE
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS"
.sp
The driver was not developed with any official documentation from Tripp Lite, so certain events may confuse the driver\&. If you observe any strange behavior, please re\-run the driver with \-DDD to increase the verbosity\&.
.sp
So far, the Tripp Lite UPSes do not seem to have a serial number or other globally unique identifier accessible through USB\&. Thus, when monitoring several Tripp Lite USB UPSes, you should use either the \fIbus\fR, \fIdevice\fR or \fIproduct\fR configuration options to uniquely specify which UPS a given driver instance should control\&.
.sp
For instance, you can easily monitor an OMNIVS1000 and a SMART1500RM2U at the same time, since they have different USB Product ID strings\&. If you have two SMART1500RM2U units, you would have to find which USB bus and device number each unit is on (via lsusb(8))\&.
.sp
Some of the SMART*2U models have a configurable Unit ID number, and you can now use the upsid config argument to uniquely specify which UPS a given driver instance should control\&. This allows for precise identification of UPS devices when multiple devices are connected\&. To retrieve or set the upsid use the \fBupsrw\fR(8) utility\&.
