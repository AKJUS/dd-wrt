Set the timer for the UPS to switch on in case the power returns after the kill power command had been sent, but before the actual switch off\&. This ensures the machines connected to the UPS are, in all cases, rebooted after a power failure\&.

The default value is 30 (in seconds)\&. Usually this

\fBnot\fR
warn you upon startup if it isn\(cqt\&. Some UPSes will restart no matter what, even if the power is (still) out at the moment this timer elapses\&. In that case, you could see whether setting
ondelay = \-1
in
\fBups\&.conf\fR
helps\&.

Set polling frequency for full updates, in seconds\&. Compared to the quick updates performed every "pollinterval" (the latter option is described in

If the device does not report
battery\&.charge, the default value is 30 seconds (fairly frequent, in case the UPS\-reported state combination does reflect a bad power condition and so the situation is urgent)\&.

See details in
onlinedischarge_log_throttle_sec

battery\&.charge
remains at or above this threshold percentage (default 100), the

Set to disable fix\-ups for broken USB encoding, etc\&. which we apply by default on certain models (vendors/products) which were reported as not following the protocol strictly\&. This flag allows to disable the feature in particular device configurations\&.
.sp
It is always possible that the vendors eventually release fixed firmware, or re\-use identifiers by which we match suspected broken devices for unrelated products, so processing these fix\-ups would be a waste of time there\&.

for instance, it was found that Eaton MGE Ellipse Max 1500 FR UPS firmware stops responding every few hours, which causes usbhid\-ups driver to detect an libusb insufficient memory error; in this case, when the usbhid\-ups driver tries to reconnect too early, the activity sometimes led the UPS firmware to crash and turn off the load immediately! Setting this parameter to 30 seconds solved this problem (while 20 seconds were not enough)\&.

.RE
.RE
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.sp
This driver is not built by default\&. You can build it by using "configure \-\-with\-usb=yes"\&. Note that it will also install other USB drivers\&.
.sp
You also need to install manually the legacy hotplug files (libhidups and libhid\&.usermap, generally in /etc/hotplug/usb/), or the udev file (nut\-usbups\&.rules, generally in /etc/udev/rules\&.d/) to address the permission settings problem\&. For more information, refer to the README file in nut/scripts/hotplug or nut/scripts/udev\&.
.SH "IMPLEMENTATION"
.SS "Selecting a specific UPS"
.sp
As mentioned above, the driver ignores the "port" value in \fBups\&.conf\fR\&. Unlike previous versions of this driver, it is now possible to control multiple UPS units simultaneously with this driver, provided they can be distinguished by setting some combination of the device\-matching options\&. For instance:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[mge]
        driver = usbhid\-ups
        port = auto
        vendorid = 0463
[tripplite]
        driver = usbhid\-ups
        port = auto
        vendorid = 09ae
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "USB Polling and Interrupt Transfers"
.sp
The \fBusbhid\-ups\fR driver has two polling intervals\&. The "pollinterval" configuration option controls what can be considered the "inner loop", where the driver polls and waits briefly for "interrupt" reports\&. The "pollfreq" option is for less frequent updates of a larger set of values, and as such, we recommend setting that interval to several times the value of "pollinterval"\&.
.sp
Many UPSes will respond to a USB Interrupt In transfer with HID reports corresponding to values which have changed\&. This saves the driver from having to poll each value individually with USB Control transfers\&. Since the OB and LB status flags are important for a clean shutdown, the driver also explicitly polls the HID paths corresponding to those status bits during the inner "pollinterval" time period\&. The "pollonly" option can be used to skip the Interrupt In transfers if they are known not to work\&.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS"
.SS "Repetitive timeout and staleness"
.sp
Some models tends to be unresponsive with the default polling frequency\&. The result is that your system log will have lots of messages like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
usb 2\-1: control timeout on ep0in
usb 2\-1: usbfs: USBDEVFS_CONTROL failed cmd usbhid\-ups rqt 128 rq 6 len 256
ret \-110
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this case, simply modify the general parameter "pollinterval" to a higher value (such as 10 seconds)\&. This should solve the issue\&.
.sp
Note that if you increase "pollinterval" beyond 10 or 15 seconds, you might also want to increase "pollfreq" by the same factor\&.
.SS "Got EPERM: Operation not permitted upon driver startup"
.sp
You have forgotten to install the hotplug files, as explained in the INSTALLATION section above\&. Don\(cqt forget to restart hotplug so that it applies these changes\&.
.SS "Unattended shutdowns"
.sp
The hardware which was used for development of this driver is almost certainly different from what you have, and not all manufacturers follow the USB HID Power Device Class specifications to the letter\&. You don\(cqt want to find out that yours has issues here when a power failure hits your server room and you\(cqre not around to manually restart your servers\&.
.sp
If you rely on the UPS to shutdown your systems in case of mains failure and to restart them when the power returns, you \fBmust\fR test this\&. You can do so by running \fIupsmon \-c fsd\fR\&. With the mains present, this should bring your systems down and then cycle the power to restart them again\&. If you do the same without mains present, it should do the same, but in this case, the outputs shall remain off until mains power is applied again\&.
.SS "UPS cuts power too soon"
.sp
Note that many Cyber Power Systems (CPS) models tend to divide offdelay by 60 and round down, so the minimum advisable value is 60 (seconds) to avoid powering off immediately after NUT sends the shutdown command to the UPS\&.
.SS "UPS does not set battery\&.charge\&.low but says OK"
.sp
Note that many Cyber Power Systems (CPS) models tend to allow only certain values for battery\&.charge\&.low and anything outside of the set of allowed values are rounded or ignored\&.
.sp
A shell loop like this can help you map out the allowed values:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
for i in `seq 90 \-1 0`; do echo "set to $i"; \e
    upsrw \-s battery\&.charge\&.low=$i \-u * \-p * cps\-big; \e
    sleep 1; upsc cps\-big battery\&.charge\&.low; echo ""; \e
done
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
For example, for CPS PR1000LCDRTXL2U model, the only allowed values are [60,55,50,45,40,35,30,25,20] and in some cases, your UPS may effectively not support a value of 10 for the battery\&.charge\&.low setting\&.
