Changes in version 1.29:

The new option '--continue-on-errno' has been added.

If ddrescue exits because of a fatal read error, it now prints the value of
the variable 'errno' so that it can be used as argument to
'--continue-on-errno'.

When using '--ask' and '--verbose', print rescue options before asking user.

Option '--log-reads' now records the value of errno if different from EIO.
(The four changes above suggested by Christian Franke).

The effect of option '-O, --reopen-on-error' has been extended to all phases.

It has been documented in the manual that '--reopen-on-error' may be needed
when using '--continue-on-errno'.

A compilation error on FiwixOS 3.3 about an ambiguous call to std::abs has
been fixed. (Reported by Jordi Sanfeliu).

The chapter 'Syntax of command-line arguments' has been added to the manual.

Two examples of combined use with lziprecover have been added to the manual.
(One of them uses the new Forward Error Correction (FEC) feature of
lziprecover).

It has been documented in the manual that option '-b' of ddrescuelog is
position dependent. (Reported by Winston B. E.).
